Canceling MySQL in Go [![GoDoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/rocketlaunchr/mysql-go?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/rocketlaunchr/mysql-go) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/rocketlaunchr/mysql-go)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/rocketlaunchr/mysql-go)
===============

This package is an experimental package to help you cancel MySQL queries.
It may or may not be suitable for your needs.

See [Article here](https://medium.com/@rocketlaunchr.cloud/canceling-mysql-in-go-827ed8f83b30) for more information.

## Dependencies

* [Go MySQL Driver](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql)

## Installation

```
go get -u github.com/rocketlaunchr/mysql-go
```

## QuickStart

```go

import (
   stdSql "database/sql"
   "github.com/rocketlaunchr/mysql-go"
)

_pool, _ := stdSql.Open("mysql", "user:password@/dbname")
_killerPool, _ := stdSql.Open("mysql", "user:password@/dbname")


pool := sql.DB{_pool, _killerPool}

```

## Read Query

```go

// Obtain an exclusive connection
conn, err := pool.Conn(ctx)
defer conn.Close() // Return the connection back to the pool

// Perform your read operation. Cancel
rows, err := conn.QueryContext(ctx, stmt)
if err != nil {
   return err
}

```

## Write Query

```go
// Obtain an exclusive connection
conn, err := pool.Conn(ctx)
defer conn.Close() // Return the connection back to the pool

// Perform the write operation
tx, err := conn.BeginTx(ctx, nil)

_, err = tx.ExecContext(ctx, stmt)
if err != nil {
   return tx.Rollback()
}

tx.Commit()
```

## Cancel Query

Cancel the context. This will call `KILL` to MYSQL automatically.

It is highly recommended you set a KillerPool when you instantiate the `DB` object.

The KillerPool is used to call the `KILL` signal.
